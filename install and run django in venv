Sure, here is a simple documentation on how to create a new Django project after cloning your repository from Github:

Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
Create a new Python environment by running the pythonvenv.sh script in the terminal.
Activate the Python environment by running the following command in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate

Install Django in the activated Python environment by running the following command in the terminal:
Copy code
pip install django

Once Django is installed, create a new Django project by running the following command in the terminal:
php
Copy code
django-admin startproject <project_name>

Replace <project_name> with the desired name of your new Django project.
After creating the project, navigate into the project directory by running the following command in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
cd <project_name>

Replace <project_name> with the name of your new Django project.
Create a new app within the project by running the following command in the terminal:
php
Copy code
python manage.py startapp <app_name>

Replace <app_name> with the desired name of your new app.

And that's it! You now have a new Django project with a new app created within it.
